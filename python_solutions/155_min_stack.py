    * Title: 155. Min Stack
    * Difficulty: Medium
    * Description: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element
    * in constant time.
    * Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/
    *
    * Verdict: A different function than most, this requires the user to have a bit of knowledge
    * when it comes to creating data types. An easier medium problem that is significantly more
    * interesting to complete because of this.
    * Language: Python
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(n)
