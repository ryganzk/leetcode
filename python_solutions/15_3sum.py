    * Title: 15. 3Sum
    * Difficulty: Medium
    * Description: Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]
    * such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
    * Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/
    *
    * Verdict: Another problem that I had a deal of difficulty solving, mostly because I believed a
    * solution existed that wasn't in O(n^2) time. Unfortunately, I never managed to find that
    * solution. While I approached this problem using a two pointer approach, I've seen solutions
    * using buckets and hash maps, so this problem seems to offer a variety of approaches
    * Language: Python
    * Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    * Space Complexity: O(n)
